# voting-app-react

This is the frontend for my voting app project that I made.

I used React.js for this project. The backend for this project can be accessed at [this link](https://github.com/Ventuscoder/voting-app-server).

5 main concepts I learned by making this project:
1. Styling the pages, of course
2. Transferring data from child to parent component
3. Using an external API and posting data to it
4. Creating a multi-page experience on just one page
5. Link copying button
